# RestaurantReviewNLP
Classifying restaurant reviews into positive and negative reviews using NLP with the help of nltk stopwords
<p>Using the <b>nltk</b> library we classified the reviews by making a model and training it on <i>stopwords</i> which is downloaded from nltk library and stored the model using <b>pickle</b> to use it later.</p>
<p>The model is saved with pickle with the name <i>reviewModel.pickle</i>. Then used that model to classify the reviews.</p>
